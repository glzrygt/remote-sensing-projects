Water Body Extraction & Edge Detection with NDWI

##Objective
To extract water bodies and delineate their boundaries using:
- NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)
- Edge-preserving smoothing
- Sobel-based gradient magnitude calculation
- Thresholding to detect water-land edges

## Data
- **Source**: NAIP 2019 Imagery
- **Bands**: Red, Green, Blue, NIR
- **Spatial Resolution**: 1 meter
- **Study Area**: Minnesota, USA

##Workflow
1. Clipping NAIP imagery to study area
2. Calculating NDWI using Green and NIR bands
3. Applying 3Ã—3 smoothing to NDWI
4. Computing Sobel gradients (horizontal & vertical)
5. Deriving gradient magnitude image
6. Applying a threshold (0.1) to extract edges

##Files
- `report.pdf`: Full project report
- `outputs/`: All intermediate and final result figures

##Highlights
- NDWI enhanced water detection
- Gradient magnitude clarified boundaries
- Thresholding successfully isolated water-land edges
- Urban-vegetation transitions introduced minor noise (noted in Discussion)
